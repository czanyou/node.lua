How to add a test
=================

* Test files are located in './test/tests.d'

* These files contain shell functions beginning with 'test' :
"
test_get_option ()
{
...
}
...
"

* shunit2 functions can be used in these functions :
http://shunit2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/2.1/doc/shunit2.html

* Additional environment variables are available :
	- ${CONFIG_DIR} : uci search path for config files. This directory is
	  reset after each test.
	- ${CHANGES_DIR} : uci search path for config change files. This directory is
	  reset after each test.
	- ${TMP_DIR} : path to a directory where can be stored temporary files
	  during tests. This directory is reset after each test.
	- ${UCI} : uci static binary called with above config and changes
	  directories as parameters.
	- ${REF_DIR} : path to a directory where can be stored reference files
	  or data.
