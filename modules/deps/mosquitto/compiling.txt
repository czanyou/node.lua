The following packages can be used to add features to mosquitto. All of them
are optional.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* openssl (version 1.0.0 or greater if TLS-PSK support is needed)
* c-ares (for DNS-SRV support, disabled by default)
* libuuid (from util-linux, can be disabled)
* tcp-wrappers (optional, package name libwrap0-dev)
* libwebsockets (optional, disabled by default, version 1.3 and above)
* On Windows, a pthreads library is required if threading support is to be
  included.

To compile, run "make", but also see the file config.mk for more details on the
various options that can be compiled in.

Where possible use the Makefiles to compile. This is particularly relevant for
the client libraries as symbol information will be included.  Use cmake to
compile on Windows or Mac.

If you have any questions, problems or suggestions (particularly related to
installing on a more unusual device like a plug-computer) then please get in
touch using the details in readme.txt.
